# KerasMNIST

Inspired by Siraj Raval's video on YouTube about deploying your Keras model to production 

Had initial challenges in cloning and running the code, after researching made some updates to the `app_file.py`

To use your Keras model driven MNIST recoginition app on your local computer simply clone the directory:
`git clone https://github.com/AnuragHalder/KerasMNIST.git`

This will create a new directory for you 'KerasMNIST`, please go into this directory and run the follwoing command:
`python app_file.py`
